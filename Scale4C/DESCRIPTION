Description: Scale4C is an R/Bioconductor package for scale-space transformation and visualization of 4C-seq data. The scale-space transformation is a multi-scale visualization technique to transform a 2D signal (e.g. 4C-seq reads on a genomic interval of choice) into a tesselation in the scale space (2D, genomic position x scale factor) by applying different smoothing kernels (Gauss, with increasing sigma). This transformation allows for explorative analysis and comparisons of the data's structure with other samples.
